# CALCULATOR

## A SIMPLE FOUR-FUNCTION CALCULATOR

**VERSION 1.0.0**

**CREATED BY**

CHRIS WEGSCHEID


##### OVERVIEW

THIS PROGRAM WILL TAKE IN, AT LEAST, TWO INTERGERS AND EXCUTE EITHER THE ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, OR DIVIDE FUNCTION BETWEEN THEM.  
AFTER WHICH IT WILL RETURN THE USER WITH RESULT OF THAT FUNCTION.


###### PROMISE TO MYSELF

USING EACH OF THE JAVASCRIPT FUNDAMENTALS I HAVE LEARNED, I WANT TO CREATE CLEAN AND READABLE CODE.
AND IF I FIND MYSELF MAKING THE CODE TOO COMPLICATED I WILL START FROM SCRATCH.


##### GENERAL PAGE LAYOUT

THE PAGE WILL BE MADE UP OF MULTIPLE PARTS; THE NUMBER INPUT, THE FUNCTION SELECTION, THE OUTPUT DISPLAY, AND THE TITLE.


THE NUMBER INPUT WILL BE A 3-COLUMN, 4-ROW GRID DISPLAYING THE NUMBERS 0-9, A DECIMAL POINT AND A NEGATIVE SIGN.

THE FUNCTION SELECTION WILL BE 6 BUTTONS STACKED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER TO THE LEFT OF THE NUMBER INPUT AREA. 
FOUR OF THE FUNCTIONS WILL BE THE ADD, SUBTRACT, DIVIDE, AND MULTIPLY AND THE FINAL TWO WILL BE THE CLEAR/RESTART AND START/SUBMIT BUTTONS.

THE OUTPUT DISPLAY WILL BE ABLE THE USER INPUT AREAS AND WILL RETURN THE RESULT OF THE NUMBER INPUT AND FUNCTION SELECTION.

THE TITLE CURRENTLY JUST SAYS "CALC ME!", BUT SHOULD BE UPDATED.

THE FINAL DESIGN OF THE PAGE IS STILL UNDECIDED.

##### HIDDEN/BONUS

MAYBE I CAN HIDE A CODE THAT WILL TRIGGER THE PAGE TO REFRESH INTO ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS
